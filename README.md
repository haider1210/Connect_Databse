It seems you're working with Python, specifically using the IPython environment. Let me break down the code for you:

```python
from IPython.display import HTML
```
This line imports the `HTML` class from the `IPython.display` module. This class allows you to display HTML content in Jupyter notebooks or IPython environments.

```python
write_query = "SELECT * FROM om_config_command_templates where model_id=:model_id"
```
Here, you're defining a SQL query string. This query selects all columns (`*`) from the table `om_config_command_templates` where the `model_id` column matches a parameter `:model_id`.

```python
result_df = oracle_db.execute_queryVTL(text(write_query).bindparams(model_id=model_id))
```
This line seems to execute the SQL query against a database using an object called `oracle_db`. It looks like it's using a method named `execute_queryVTL` to execute the query. `text(write_query)` prepares the query string, and `.bindparams(model_id=model_id)` binds the parameter `model_id` with a value `model_id`. The result is stored in a DataFrame named `result_df`.

```python
styled_output = f"<pre style='cursor: text;' onclick='window.getSelection().selectAllChildren(this);'>{result_df}</pre>"
```
This line creates an HTML string (`styled_output`) containing a `<pre>` (preformatted text) tag. The content of the `<pre>` tag is the DataFrame `result_df` wrapped in backticks (`{}`). The `style` attribute sets the cursor to text and adds an `onclick` event to select all the text within the `<pre>` tag when clicked.

It's worth noting that directly converting a DataFrame to HTML like this might not provide the desired formatting. You may want to explore other methods for displaying DataFrames in HTML, such as using the `to_html()` method provided by pandas. Additionally, be cautious about directly embedding user input (like SQL queries) into your code to prevent SQL injection attacks. Using parameterized queries, as shown here, is a good practice to mitigate this risk.
